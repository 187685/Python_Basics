# Python_Basics

# Exercise: Your First Program
# Write your code below. Don't forget to press Shift+Enter to execute the cell
print("Hello, world!")

# Exercise: Data Types
# What is the data type of the result of: 6 / 2?
solution: type(6/2)
# What is the type of the result of: 6 // 2? (Note the double slash //.)
solution: type(6//2)

# Exercise: Expression and Variables
# What is the value of x where x = 3 + 2 * 2
solution: 7
# What is the value of y where y = (3 + 2) * 2?
solution: 10
# What is the value of z where z = x + y?
solution: 17

  # Exercise: Strings
  # What is the value of the variable a after the following code is executed?
  a = "1"
solution: "1"
# What is the value of the variable b after the following code is executed?
b = "2"
solution: "2"
 # What is the value of the variable c after the following code is executed?
 c = a + b
solution: "12"
# Consider the variable d use slicing to print out the first three elements:
d = "ABCDEFG"
solution: print(d[:3]) 
# or 
print(d[0:3])
# Use a stride value of 2 to print out every second character of the string e:
e = 'clocrkr1e1c1t'
solution: print(e[::2])
# Print out a backslash:
solution: print(r"\\\\\\ ")
or
print(r"\ ")
# Convert the variable f to uppercase:
f = "You are wrong"
solution: f.upper()
# Consider the variable g, and find the first index of the sub-string snow:
g = "Mary had a little lamb Little lamb, little lamb Mary had a little lamb \
Its fleece was white as snow And everywhere that Mary went Mary went, Mary went \
Everywhere that Mary went The lamb was sure to go"
solution: g.find("snow")
# In the variable g, replace the sub-string Mary with Bob:
solution: g.replace("Mary", "Bob")
